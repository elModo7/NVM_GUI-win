# Graphical Node.js Version Manager for Windows
Because *Windows UAC* prompts are annoying and I don't want to have an *elevated CMD window* open all the time.

Basically a *graphical wrapper* of **nvm.exe**:
- Install new node versions
- List installed node versions
- List available for download node versions
- Uninstall node versions
